# Problem Statement Real-Time Web chat
 Create open-source library and Using HTML, Css, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React.js, aes256encryption, and Socket.io..That simplifies adding real-time web functionality to web applications.

Gaming, social networks, email client and chat are the most commonly applications which require real-timenotifications and updates. In recent times, real-time chat applications have grown tremendously. Most organizationshaveadopted them for communication. For security reasons, the messages exchanged over thenetworkmust be encrypted. How the app works We‚Äôll create a secret key and store it in the frontend for demonstration purposes. The keyissavedin a .ENV variable where the frontend has been deployed in a server. Whenever a user sendsorreceives a message, the message will be encrypted or decrypted using an aes256 npmpackagewith the same secret key . Creating the backend For the backend, we‚Äôll use Node.js and the Express framework. Socket.io is needed toproviderealtime, two-way communication between the backend server and the frontend.
